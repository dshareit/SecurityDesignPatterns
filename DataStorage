Client Side (*** studies done after 2012 showed that more than 63% of applications contain a data storage vulnerability ***):

    Internal Storage:
    
        Data being stored on the mobile device in
        - Cleartext
        - Obfuscated Format
        - Hard-coded Key

          Other Forms may include:
                -
                -
                -
            
    External Storage (removable sd card, etc..)
